            Please do not rely on the postcode as it is shared with 25 other properties within half a mile of Nant-y-Big. Unfortunately they are not sign posted at the main road since the adjoining land belongs to others. From Sarn Bach proceed towards Cilan. After approximately 600 metres you will see a green metal shed on your left and the turning for Nant y-Big is 30 metres further on (also on your left). <br>
            <br>
            There are No Through Road and Pedestrian signs at the single-track road entrance. Proceed along the road for a further 400 metres until you reach Nant-y-Big. Turn immediately right at the barrier system to arrive at reception. If no staff members are apparent upon your arrival at reception, please use the intercom system by pressing the top button, to let them know of your arrival. You will need the name/nym you booked under. <br>
            <br>
            If you are going to be arriving after 6pm then please let us know in advance if possible. <br>
