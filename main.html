            Bitcoin Beach Retreat <br>
            7th-10th July 2023 <br>
            Nant-y-Big, Wales <br>

                What is the Bitcoin Beach Retreat?
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
                A 3 night gathering at a stunning campsite and beach in North Wales - 110 Bitcoiners with a shared passion of a brighter more orange future. <br>
                <br>
                Proudly Bitcoin only, we are retreating from no-coiners, shitcoiners and clown world to recharge our batteries, reunite with friends, make new ones, learn from our peers and enjoy a few drinks and BBQs under the stars. <br>
                <br>
                Starting in 2021 with a two night gathering of 35 intrepid anons from Bitcoin Twitter and including an impromptu Lightning workshop & quiz, growing in 2022 into a three night sold out event with 100 Bitcoiners including 11 peers kindly doing workshops/talks. <br>
                <br>
                We are not a conference where speakers are booked in advance. Bitcoiners book onto the Retreat and we crowdsource any talks from there as we are blessed to be surrounded by Bitcoiners with skills to share. <br>
                <br>
                Come alone, with your friends, partner or family - all are welcome. We have Nant-y-Big campsite to ourselves, picture more of a chilled retreat than Glastonbury. Overlooking the coast, we’ll have a marquee with power and wifi in down a little valley, also used as BBQ HQ and wet weather back-up, not that it ever rains in Wales! <br>
                <br>
                Nearby access to toilets with a separate shower and bigger toilet block a little further away. We also have the fields above the valley to stretch out into and limited electrical hook-ups for campervans available in a ‘quiet/family’ field about 2 mins walk away. <br>
                <br>
                Bitcoiners will need to bring all camping equipment required and bring and cook all food except for on Saturday and Sunday evenings where food will be supplied. <br>
                <br>
                The Bitcoin Beach Retreat is not organised for profit, everything is spent on the event so any offers of help, assistance and ideas appreciated. Offering value and staying accessible for everyone. <br>
                <br>
                A big thankyou to the inspiration behind us starting the Bitcoin Beach Retreat: The Bitcoin Bush Bash in Australia. (linked to article) <br>
